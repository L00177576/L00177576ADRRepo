# High level architecture for the research submission APP

To identify the best practices to implement the solution to avoid time delays in the approval process

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The researchers and scientists submit their pressentations through this portal have some delays to get approval on time , so they are unable to presnt in those events and there is huge loss incurred by the research department.
 
## Decision

Current process has 2 stage approval in which second ateg can only start after the first phase completes, that can be avoided by doing these approvals in parallel.

## Consequences

This would avoid the delays in approvals and could help spped up the process.
